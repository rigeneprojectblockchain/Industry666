Process, resource and scheduler management logic to meet the specific needs of Industry 6.6.6

Process management:
In the context of Industry 6.6.6, you may have processes involving classical, quantum, and biological computation. Each process would have specific attributes, including a type indicating the type of computation involved. For example:

class Process:
    def __init__(self, pid, name, computation_type):
        self.pid = pid
        self.name = name
        self.state = "ready"
        self.resources = {}
        self.computation_type = computation_type

    def execute(self):
        if self.computation_type == "classical":
            # Execute classical computation
        elif self.computation_type == "quantum":
            # Execute quantum computation
        elif self.computation_type == "biological":
            # Execute biological computation

Resource Management:
In Industry 6.6.6, you should manage different resources, including CPUs for classical computation, quantum processors for quantum computation, and biological resources for biological computation. You can implement a resource management class that keeps track of available resources and assigns them to processes based on their computation type and specific requirements. For example:

class ResourceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.available_resources = {
            "classical_cpu": 10,
            "quantum_processor": 5,
            "biological_resources": 100
        }

    def allocate_resources(self, process, resource_name, amount):
        if resource_name in self.available_resources and self.available_resources[resource_name] >= amount:
            self.available_resources[resource_name] -= amount
            process.resources[resource_name] = amount
            process.state = "running"
        else:
            process.state = "waiting"

    def release_resources(self, process):
        for resource_name, amount in process.resources.items():
            self.available_resources[resource_name] += amount
        process.resources = {}

Schedulers:
The scheduler will determine the order in which the processes are executed, considering the resource requirements and the type of computation. The scheduler can be implemented as a class that orders processes based on certain metrics, such as priority, computation type, or Industry-specific algorithms 6.6.6.

class Scheduler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ready_queue = []

    def add_to_queue(self, process):
        self.ready_queue.append(process)

    def schedule(self):
        # Implement scheduling logic to consider resources and type of computation
        pass

Please note that this is just a starting point and that resource management and scheduling will be complex in a complete Industry 6.6.6 operating system. You will need to further develop these components to effectively manage the integration of classical, quantum and biological technologies.
This code is currently in a testing and prototyping phase. It is intended for demonstration and conceptual purposes, and it may not be suitable for production use. The codebase is a work in progress, and it may undergo significant changes in future updates.
